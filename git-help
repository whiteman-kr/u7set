	$ git checkout --track -b local_branch_name origin/remote_branch_name


4. Stable/release instruction

	1. Switch to master branch

	$ git checkout master
	
	
	2. Merge changes from develop

	$ git merge develop

	
	3. Push changes to remote server
	
	$ git push

	
	4. Delete current Release Build if exists!

	6. Run u7.exe and call About dialog to show program version (v0.0.0000)

	7. Give a version tag to current commit
