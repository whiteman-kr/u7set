<h2>v2.2.0</h2>
<h3>Release date: 19.dec.2008</h3>

<h4>New features:</h4>
<ul>
<li>"Zone" feature for sections</li>
<li>Dynamic (automatic) height option of Texts, Fields and Labels</li>
<li>Automatic height option of both report sections</li>
<li>"Remove if blank" feature of report sections</li>
<li>printWhen expression for sections</li>
<li>In designer the Text/Html item edit now enables using pure html.</li>
<li>There are some new and updated dialogs in designer</li>
</ul>

<p class="notes">Remark to Zones:<br>
All items can have a specified Zone ID. Items with the same zone id, just like a group,
represent a zone as a ribbon inside the section. When the section's automatic height option is enabled,
the report engine will process the rendering of zones in order by zone id, one after another.
If a content of a zone is empty in case the "print when" expression of all items in the zone returns false,
the zone won't be printed and the section is 'shrunken'. The rendering order of zones match to the order 
of zone IDs.</p>

<h4>Bugfixes:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Dynamically expanded HTML/Text items might have zero height now. It is important for text items who have a datasource in detail section for to realize an empty line when no data are fetched from datasource</li>
<li>Designer: fixed the unrefreshed detail section title bug</li>
<li>Designer: Section property dialog introduced.</li>
<li>In designer the HTML/Text property dialog now saves the printWhen option and the template text</li>
<li>Invalid parameters and variables now don't shown as '#data#' in report, but as empty string instead.</li>
<li>Test data editor / Designer: Fixed the crash occured when the last test data table was removed</li>
<li>Many small fixes and optimalizations</li>
</ul>
