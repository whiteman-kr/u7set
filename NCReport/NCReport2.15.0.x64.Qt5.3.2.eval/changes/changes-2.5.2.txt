New features
------------

#215 - Performance optimalization 
    Large and complex reports should be faster by optimal field and dynamic item evaluation
	Fields and dynamic items are updated much more efficient than earlier.

#218 - Orphaned group headers at the bottom of page
    To avoid an 'orphaned' group header at the bottom of page by
    a new feature of sections is introduced: 'Break tolerance'
    This is as a value of keeping space to the end of page is still toleranced until pagebreak
    Reccomended approx 18mm-25mm

#221 - Enable to set printer quality (High/Screen resolution)
    QPrinter::HighResolution | QPrinter::ScreenResolution modes in printer based outputs
	Usage: report->setReportQuality( QPrinter::PrintMode ) 
	or 
	output = new NCReportPrinterOutput( QPrinter::PrintMode )

Fixed bugs
----------

#216 - Unwanted reprint group header
    Sometimes group headers are unneccessarily repeated after page break.
    This matter is when multiple group levels.

#217 - Report Preview an Printout layout synchronization / trim
    printed High resolution reports are sometimes smaller then in preview mode.
    This because font scalings are a bit different in screen or/and print resolution.
    They should be closer to each other.


#219 - Unnecessarily variable update when a special case
    In multi detail mode the second or x. detail the group totals were sometimes
    unneccessarily updated.

#220 - Total page count in double pass mode sometimes fails
    Total page count (double pass mode) sometimes calculates wrong value for very long reports
    with dynamic texts. This because of High and Screen resolution difference.

#178, #222 - Multiple details - empty data situation
	The bug was still existed in previous version but now is fixed. When multiple details 
	are existed and one or more is related to an empty datas source, the detail is skipped.

#224 - Print's only default number of copies
	Changing number of printing copies in showing QPrintDialog not responding to QPrinter.
	(maybe is occured on some printers)

#225 - Field update on group footer and page footer when subqueries are used.
	If subqueries are used, the footer (group/page) is taken from next detail 
	record and it shouldn't.

#226 - Parameter editor in designer: Removed parameters are reloaded again
	Removed parameters are reloaded again after restarting the Designer application.

#227 - Groupheader is one page late in some cases
	A bug that was formerly fixed is back. When working with groupheaders, 
	the headers are one page too late
