<h3>About this design...</h3>
<p>
This design was originally created by looking at the Microsoft.com site. However, 
absolutely no code was copied or used from the Microsoft site. It is simply a 
visual rendering rewritten in XHTML 1.0 Strict along with CSS 2.0.
</p>
<p>
I didn't like my FrontPage site because...it looked too FrontPagie. So I was 
doing an MS update and saw thier site and decided I'd like to try to remake it. I hope you like it.
</p>
<p>I've spent over 300 hours on this design since Jan. 3, 3004. I learned a lot from this design throughout this year.</p> 
<h4>Requirements</h4>
<ul>
<li>One</li>
<li>Two</li>
<li>Three</li>
</ul>
<p>
This design looks best using IE 5.0 and up using a resolution of 800&times;600. 
This design has actually been written twice. The first time, I used tables, bad 
html grammar and the lot. But on the second go around, I only used DIV's to 
align tabular data. <b>The positioning of DIV's takes some doing until</b> you get used 
to it, but fortunately, I had a lot of practice while making GradientX. <br />
Also, make sure you view this in a maximized window. I used mostly precents instead
of pixels or something else. So it looks ok in 800&times;600 and looks great in 1024&times;768.
</p>
<br />
Some classes and id's in the style sheets aren't used in this design, but feel free to play around with them and see how they look.
<br /> 
A note on the CSS filter effects: Filters are only useable in IE. A way to make the gradients show in Netscape is to use an image. 
(I've found that the GIMP2 does a nice gradient.) Other than that, it should work.
