<h3>Another title</h3>
<p>
This design was originally created by looking at the Microsoft.com site. However, 
absolutely no code was copied or used from the Microsoft site. It is simply a 
visual rendering rewritten in XHTML 1.0 Strict along with CSS 2.0.

<p align="right">
I didn't like my FrontPage site because...it looked too FrontPagie. So I was 
doing an MS update and saw thier site and decided I'd like to try to remake it. I hope you like it.
</p>
<p>I've spent over 300 hours on this design since Jan. 3, 3004. I learned a lot from this design throughout this year.</p>
