New features
------------

#206 Barcode content as parameter
     In many cases it is very handy if one could set the content of a barcode via parameter. 
	 For example: my application prints a documentID on each Invoice, which is the same for 
     the whole report at this time, so it makes no sense putting it to the data source

Fixed bugs
----------

#180 Fixed Image height or width keeping aspect ratio
     Since image size not always the same size, image element can have an option to use 
     the actual image size, and not the fixed size that defined by the desiner.
     All items below the image will position after the actual image height, 
     (instead of empty spcae between the image and the items below today).

#204 Slow QImage printout in high resolution - fixed. 
	 Without smooth transformation, the image printing now is very fast.

#205 Qt4.3 Backward compatibility
     NCReport should be able to compile under Qt4.3 >=
     Some features should be backported or version dependent.

#207 PrintWhen expression problem in group footer
     For example i have test data of 9 row's grouped into 3 groups. Each group 
     has header and footer.
     When I try to display certain column value in header of the group, it displays 
     the first rows (of that group) value. I figured out, that in header I have little 
     bit different situation - if I try to display column value, it takes it from the 
     last group row.
     Till here everything is splendid, but the problem is, that PrintWhen expression 
     is not working correctly in footer, 
     because it takes not the last row of that group, but the next group first row value.
     PrintWhen expressions are working perfectly in header.

#208 Text fields in page footer are not printed sometimes
     Text fields in page footer, which are filled by a parameter are only printed on the 
     last page's footer, on all other pages, there is no text.

#209 CUSTOM page size is ignored both in engine and designer 
     "CUSTOM" page size is ignored (parameter is not saved).

#210 connID if is empty, then "qt_sql_default_conneciton" name is not working
     (when creating QSqlDatabase without specifying it's name).

#211 Image without "keep aspect ratio" is printed in different size then its 
     shown in preview window.

#214 Status of Fields/Texts in page footer
